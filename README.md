# Lab 1 -- Learning to use Java Math, Input, and Output

* 30 points										
* Due: 9/22/2023 11:59 PM New York Time

## Purpose: 

This assignment is aimed at giving you experience with Java math, variables, and user input. It will also give you more practice with IntelliJ and GitHub.

## Problem:

You are doing some grocery shopping and would like to figure out how much it is going to cost. However, you only have two hands and you have to walk home. Thus, you are going to buy exactly two bags of things. You are going to write a program to provide you with a receipt for your shopping trip.

## Details:
The program will ask for three pieces of infortmation about each item:
* The name of the item.
* The number of units of the item. This store does *NOT* sell fractional units of things.
* The cost per unit.

After collecting the information for two(2) items, the program will output the items purchased, the cost per item, and the total cost.
 
A sample run of the program may look like this:

```
Welcome to Dr. Cui's Shop'n'Save'n'Enjoy, home of the discount dish towel. 
We hope you had a pleasent shopping experience and would be thrilled to provide you with a receipt to use as a momento of your time here with us today.

What was the first item that you purchased?
Astronaut Ice Cream
Great! How many units of Astronaut Ice Cream did you buy?
67
Okay! How much did Astronaut Ice Cream cost per unit?
1.05

What was the second item that you purchased?
A ride on a grizzley bear
Great! How many units of A ride on a grizzley bear did you purchase?
1
Okay! How much did A ride on a grizzley bear cost per unit?
23.99

Sounds like you had a productive shopping trip. Here is your receipt:

*****
Astronaut Ice Cream 67@1.05	70.35
A ride of a grizzley bear 1@23.99 23.99
----------
TOTAL: 94.34

Thanks for your visit. Have a day.

## Requirements:

1.  Complete a set of test cases.
2.  Complete an algorithm or psuedocode before you program.
3.  Follow good programming practices including peer programming (When 1/2 the code is written, or 1/2 of class is over, switch drivers).
4.  Ensure your code meets all detailed requirements.
5.  Properly use variables (including enrsuring the type is correct), input, math, and output.
6.  Use your test cases to test that your program works correctly. Fix any errors.

## Reminders: 

You will write your program in the "pair programming" mode: one of you is the driver while the other is the navigator.

1.  Make sure you *understand the problem* you are being asked to solve. What are the input(s), output(s), and calculation(s)?

2.  *Write Test Cases*: create a series of test cases in Excel to use to determine that your program works correctly.  Ideally, have excel calculate the answer for you.

3.  *Complete the algorithm* for your calculations that is started in algorithm.txt. **Whoever didn't type the majority of the test cases, should type the algorithm** Your program should do ALL of the calculations for you, and should work for ANY valid inputs. You do not need to do error checking, yet.

4.  *Code*: Create a new Java file, and follow your algorithm to write your code. You may assume that your input will always be of the correct type. Whoever has done the least typing at this point should start as driver.

5.  *Fix compiler errors*: Run your program and fix any errors that appear.

6.  *Test:* Once your code runs and you think itâ€™s complete, test it using your test cases -- run, give the input value as input, and see if you get the right output. If not, you need to fix the error(s) in your code!

7.  Make sure youâ€™ve created a human readable essay (i.e. your program). Did you follow the code readability guidelines? If not, fix your code so that it is readable. You should have comments above each chunk of code!

8.  Include an updated version of the intro comments below at the very top of your Python file. Do not include the brackets `[` and `]` but replace them with what is asked for inside of them. Be sure to keep the titles at the start of each line. 
  ```
  # Programmers:  [your names here]
  # Course:  CS212, Dr. Cui 
  # Due Date: 9/22/2023
  # Lab Assignment: 1
  # Problem Statement: [describe what task this program performs]
  # Data In: [list the type of information your user input requests]
  # Data Out:  [list the type of information output with print]
  # Credits: [Is your code based on an example in the book, in class, or something else?]
  ```

9.  Once you are done in lab, even if you havenâ€™t finished the assignment yet, you need to Commit and Push your changes, and upload your test cases to Moodle.

## What to Submit:

1.  To GitHub:  
    a. Completed .java file  
    b. Algorithm in algorithm.txt  

2. To Moodle in the Lab1 assignment (only one partner needs to do this): An Excel file with your test cases. 
 
3. To Moodle in the Lab1 assignment: An individual reflection on the lab (at most 1 page in Word, please keep it concise) This should be in Word, PDF, or text. No .pages!. You should address at least the following questions:  
    a.  How was the experience working with your partner?   
    b.  What did you learn in this lab?   
    c.  What were the easiest and hardest things about working with types?  
    d.  What were the easiest and hardest things about working with user input?

As a reminder, reflections count toward your participation grade.
